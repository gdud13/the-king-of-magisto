  <h2>ðŸ‘‘ King of Magisto</h2>
  <p>Long ago, the Kingdom of Magisto stood as a fractured land of tribes, secrets, and fading magic...</p>
  <p>In the southern reaches lies the forgotten village of Stonebay â€” a place of cliffs, silence, and ghosts.</p>
  <p>He doesn't know it yet, but this morning will mark the beginning of his rise... or his ruin.</p>
  <p>Will you guide him toward a crown that may cost his soul?</p>
